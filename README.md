# clusterEX_cliques_Scerevisiae

The information presented here is based on the publication "Genome-wide analysis of yeast expression data based on a priori generated co-regulation cliques" 
authored by Siyuan Sima, Lukas Schmauder and Klaus Richter in Microbial Cell (2019), Jan 22;6(3):160-176 as doi: 10.15698/mic2019.03.671. 

The cliques have been obtained by using microarray data from public repositories to connect all genes via their coexpression relationships and then cutting the genome-wide network to extract individual cliques. This way all genes of the organism present on the used array type are assigned to a clique. 

Three types of tables can be found for download:

    Full table of all experiments used to derive the network and the coexpression cliques
    Full table of all genes and their association to specific cliques
    Full table of all cliques and their GO-term and transcription factor enrichment
